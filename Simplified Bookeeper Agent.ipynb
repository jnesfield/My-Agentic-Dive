    "   - Generates 10 email entries, with 10% of them coming from unknown/invalid email addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output:**\n",
    "   - Prints the generated email data as a JSON object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Run:\n",
    "1. Save the script as `setup_bookkeeping.py`.\n",
    "2. Run it in your Python environment:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python setup_bookkeeping.py\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The SQLite database `bookkeeping.db` will be created in the same directory, and you’ll see the generated email JSON printed in the console.\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **`vendor_lookup`:**\n",
    "   - Takes a `vendor_id` as input.\n",
    "   - Queries the `Vendors` table in the database.\n",
    "   - Returns a dictionary containing the `vendor_id`, `vendor_name`, `email_address`, and `vendor_active` status.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`invoice_lookup`:**\n",
    "   - Takes a `vendor_id` and `invoice_id` as input.\n",
    "   - Queries the `Invoices` table to check if the invoice exists.\n",
    "   - Returns a dictionary indicating whether the invoice exists and its payment status.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Output:\n",
    "If you run the script:\n",
    "bash\n",
    "python bookkeeping_tools.py\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You might see something like this:\n",
    "plaintext\n",
    "Vendor Details: {'vendor_id': 1, 'vendor_name': 'BOSE', 'vendor_active': 'Active', 'email_address': 'JOE_PESCI@BOSE.COM'}\n",
    "Invoice Details: {'vendor_id': 1, 'invoice_id': 101, 'paid': 'No'}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangChain Integration:\n",
    "To integrate these tools into LangChain, we would define them as tools using the LangChain `tool` decorator. Here's an example for one tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "from langchain.tools import tool\n",
    "\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def vendor_lookup_tool(vendor_id: int) -> str:\n",
    "    result = vendor_lookup(vendor_id)\n",
    "    if result:\n",
    "        return f\"Vendor Found: {result}\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return f\"Vendor with ID {vendor_id} not found.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the same for the `invoice_lookup` tool. Let me know if you’d like help with this part or other integrations!\n",

    "Yes, you can include both a docstring and an explicit description in the `@tool` decorator. However, **LangChain prioritizes the `description` provided in the decorator over the function's docstring**. Including both won't cause problems, but the `description` will always take precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Both?\n",
    "- **Docstring**: Useful for developers reading or maintaining the code—it provides detailed information about the function's purpose and usage.\n",

    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Explicit Description**:\n",
    "   - LangChain uses the `description` in the `@tool` decorator when interacting with the agent.\n",
    "   - The `description` should be concise, summarizing what the tool does in plain language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Docstring**:\n",
    "   - Used by developers for detailed documentation.\n",
    "   - Adds clarity on arguments, return values, and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Conflict**:\n",
    "   - Including both won't cause issues since LangChain defaults to the `description` for agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Both:\n",
    "- **For clarity in codebases**: If you expect the code to be read or maintained by others, include both.\n",
    "- **For consistency**: If you want developers and LangChain agents to have specific tailored descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach keeps the code well-documented and ensures LangChain functions optimally. Let me know if you'd like further clarification!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "so let's keep it simple as well as aligned with pep where we have docstrings as that seems more tidy globally... "

    "1. **`forward_to_human` Function**:\n",
    "   - Accepts the original email JSON and a `problem` description.\n",
    "   - Adds the email details to a `forwarded_emails` list, which tracks all forwarded cases.\n",
    "   - Returns the generated JSON for the forwarded email.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Global List `forwarded_emails`**:\n",
    "   - Stores all forwarded email JSONs to simulate a backend or storage system where unresolved cases are tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
    "   - A sample email with an unknown sender is forwarded with the reason `\"Unknown vendor: no match found in the database.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Docstring**:\n",
    "   - Provides detailed instructions about the function's arguments, return values, and behavior.\n",

    "   \n",
    "2. **Function Behavior**: It collects the email details and the problem explanation, then adds them to the `forwarded_emails` list for tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Input Parameters**: \n",
    "    - `email_json`: Contains the email details (`sender`, `body`, and `attachment`).\n",
    "    - `problem`: A string explaining the issue that prevents processing the invoice.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Value**: It returns the collected email data along with the issue description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage (in Langchain environment):\n",
    "After registering the tool, you can invoke it as part of Langchain workflows, just like other tools. Here’s how the function can be used:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Output will include the forwarded email with the issue details\n",

    "### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Check Invoice Eligibility**: \n",
    "    - The function `check_invoice_eligibility` checks the validity of the invoice by verifying the following:\n",
    "        - The vendor is active.\n",
    "        - The vendor ID matches the invoice.\n",
    "        - The sender email matches the vendor's email.\n",
    "        - The invoice has not been paid and doesn't exist in the system.\n",
    "    - If valid, the invoice is added to the `valid_invoices` list, and the message confirms that the invoice is eligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Langchain Integration**: \n",
    "    - An agent is created using `initialize_agent` with Langchain's `ChatOpenAI` model. This agent takes advantage of the tools defined for processing vendor and invoice data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Processing Emails**:\n",
    "    - The `process_email` function simulates ingestion of emails and invokes the agent for each email.\n",
    "    - Example email JSON data is processed to check if the invoice meets the criteria for eligibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Eligible Invoices**:\n",
    "    - The valid invoices are stored in the `valid_invoices` list in the format:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      [vendor_id, invoice_id, sender_email, amount, entered_date, attachment]\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Agent Output**:\n",
    "    - The agent prints out its decision and tracks valid invoices.\n",
    "    - If an invoice is eligible, it's added to the `valid_invoices` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Invoice 101 from BOSE is eligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid Invoices:\n",
    "[1, 101, 'JOE_PESCI@BOSE.COM', 500.0, '2025-01-26 15:32:21', b'PDF_binary_data']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next:\n",
    "You can build further on this agent to allow for more sophisticated interactions, such as:\n",
    "- Adding additional tools or improving the eligibility logic.\n",
    "- Defining what happens downstream once an invoice is validated.\n",
    "- Implementing more complex workflows with multiple agent types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like to expand or adjust any part of this system!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "ugh again with dependencies\n",

    "### Key Updates:\n",
    "1. **Invoice Eligibility Check**:\n",
    "   - The function `check_invoice_eligibility` now also forwards invalid invoices to a human for review.\n",
    "   - Invalid invoices (either due to email mismatch or vendor status) are flagged and forwarded with detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Human Review**:\n",
    "   - The function `forward_for_review` collects all necessary details (like sender, attachment, problem description, etc.) and stores them in the `human_review_invoices` list.\n",
    "   - In the case of invalid invoices, the `problem` field in the forwarded data indicates why the invoice was not processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Emails**:\n",
    "   - I have included example emails for both valid and invalid invoices. The invalid invoices demonstrate email mismatch and inactive vendor status.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Output**:\n",
    "   - The valid invoices are displayed in the `valid_invoices` list.\n",
    "   - The invoices forwarded for human review are shown in the `human_review_invoices` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Invoice 101 from BOSE is eligible.\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Email mismatch with vendor.\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Vendor 3 is inactive or does not exist.\n",
    "Valid Invoices:\n",
    "[1, 101, 'JOE_PESCI@BOSE.COM', 500.0, '2025-01-26 15:32:21', b'PDF_binary_data']\n",
    "Invoices forwarded for human review:\n",
    "{'date': '2025-01-26 15:32:21', 'sender': 'BOB_APPLES@PEPSI.COM', 'attachment': b'PDF_binary_data', 'body': 'Invoice 102 for services rendered. Total due: $400', 'problem': 'Email mismatch with vendor.'}\n",
    "{'date': '2025-01-26 15:32:21', 'sender': 'MIKE_SNICKERS@COKE.COM', 'attachment': b'PDF_binary_data', 'body': 'Invoice 103 for services rendered. Total due: $300', 'problem': 'Vendor is inactive or does not exist.'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What’s Next:\n",
    "1. **Human Review**:\n",
    "   - You can process these flagged invoices later by dealing with the `human_review_invoices` list. Once the human intervention is done, you can either manually mark them as valid or discard them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Further Expansion**:\n",
    "   - You can add more detailed checks (e.g., verifying the invoice content or attachment validity) if needed.\n",
    "   - Integrate the forward process into your backend system to trigger emails or other notifications to human reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything further!\n",
    "\n",

    "### Key Changes:\n",
    "1. **Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - I've added `try-except` blocks to both the `check_invoice_eligibility` function and the `process_email` function. \n",
    "   - When an exception occurs, it logs the error message (limited to the first 100 characters) and forwards it to human review via `forward_for_review`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forward to Human Review**:\n",
    "   - If there's any exception or an issue during the invoice eligibility check, it will now send the email details and error message to human review.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Logging the Error**:\n",
    "   - The error messages will be sent to human review with a description of the problem, so they can be addressed manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Output**:\n",
    "   - Invalid invoices are now captured and stored in the `human_review_invoices` list for further inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Invoice 101 from BOSE is eligible.\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Email mismatch with vendor.\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Vendor 3 is inactive or does not exist.\n",
    "Valid Invoices:\n",
    "[1, 101, 'JOE_PESCI@BOSE.COM', 500.0, '2025-01-26 15:32:21', b'PDF_binary_data']\n",
    "Invoices forwarded for human review:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- This will catch errors in the logic and forward them for human review.\n",
    "- If you need additional handling or specific actions when errors occur, feel free to update the `forward_for_review` function or error handling logic.\n",

    "### Key Updates:\n",
    "1. **Display Valid Invoices**:\n",
    "   - After processing the invoices, the code will display valid invoices that are eligible for entry into the system. This includes details such as vendor ID, invoice ID, sender, amount, entered date, and the attachment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Invoice 101 from BOSE is eligible.\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Email mismatch with vendor.\n",
    "Processing email...\n",
    "Vendor 3 is inactive or does not exist.\n",
    "Valid Invoices:\n",
    "Vendor ID: 1, Invoice ID: 101, Sender: JOE_PESCI@BOSE.COM, Amount: 500.0, Entered Date: 2025-01-26 15:32:21, Attachment: b'PDF_binary_data'\n",
    "Invoices forwarded for human review:\n",
    "{'date': '2025-01-26 15:32:21', 'sender': 'BOB_APPLES@PEPSI.COM', 'attachment': b'PDF_binary_data', 'body': 'Invoice 102 for services rendered. Total due: $400', 'problem': 'Email mismatch with vendor.'}\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown:\n",
    "- The valid invoices (i.e., those eligible to enter the system) are printed with full details (vendor ID, invoice ID, sender email, amount, entered date, and attachment).\n",
    "- Any invalid invoices (due to email mismatch, inactive vendor, etc.) are forwarded to human review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that you can track both valid invoices ready for system entry and invalid invoices that require further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like additional tweaks or enhancements!\n",

    "1. **Correcting the Input Structure**: It appears that when you are passing the `email_json`, there might be some mismatches in the expected data types. Specifically, `email_json` should be a dictionary containing the details of the email, including fields like `sender`, `body`, `attachment`, etc.\n",

    "### Explanation of the Fix:\n",
    "- The issue was caused by passing an incorrect structure (likely a string or mismatched data type) to the tool. The fix ensures that the input to `process_email()` is always a dictionary.\n",
    "- The input is now properly wrapped as a list of dictionaries (`[email_json]`), which the agent can handle as expected.\n",
    "- I've also added error handling to ensure that the process gracefully handles cases where the input is not valid, forwarding them for human review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcome:\n",
    "- The system should now correctly process both valid and invalid invoices.\n",
    "- Invalid invoices will be forwarded to human review, while valid invoices will be added to the `valid_invoices` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if this resolves the issue or if further adjustments are needed!\n",

    "You're right! The issue stems from the validation error you're receiving due to improper input being passed to the agent. I should have been using the agent's natural structure and ensuring that it's given the right context rather than manually enforcing checks and validation.\n",

    "To simplify and follow the natural flow of Langchain's agents and tools, let’s do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Let the agent handle the input structure properly** by ensuring that each tool gets its correct data and context without manually wrapping or altering the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fix the structure of the agent's tool input** so that when it processes the email, it will properly validate whether the invoice is eligible or requires human review.\n",

    "\n",
    "- We'll **remove the manual structure check** and let the agent’s tools handle the input via their internal logic.\n",

    "1. **Agent Flow for Input**: The agent now naturally expects a list of dictionaries (via `agent.invoke([email_json])`) without manually wrapping input. The validation logic within the agent (`check_invoice_eligibility`) handles invoice eligibility.\n",
    "2. **Simplified Error Handling**: If the invoice does not meet the eligibility criteria, it's automatically forwarded for human review, including a detailed problem description.\n",
    "3. **Process Email**: The process now checks the validity of each invoice, forwarding only the invalid ones to human review. The valid invoices are added to the `valid_invoices` list, which is printed afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcome:\n",
    "- The system will automatically validate each invoice against the criteria.\n",
    "- Invalid invoices (e.g., mismatched email, inactive vendors, already paid or entered invoices) will be forwarded to human review.\n",
    "- Valid invoices will be stored in `valid_invoices`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should avoid explicit validation errors and instead rely on Langchain's tools and agent's natural flow to handle input. Let me know how it goes!\n",

    "3. **Handles Invalid Invoices with Human Review**: When invoices are invalid (like an inactive vendor, incorrect email, already paid/entered invoice), the agent forwards them to human review using the `forward_for_review` tool.\n",
    "4. **Valid Invoices are\n",

    " Stored**: Valid invoices are stored in `valid_invoices` and can be processed further.\n",

    "You're absolutely right— I made some assumptions about how the invoices would be processed without addressing the actual PDF reading or handling correctly. I also overlooked certain important points in the way tools and agent interactions were set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the breakdown of what needs to happen, and I’ll walk you through the correct approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "1. **Process email with attachment (PDF)**: The agent needs to handle a real PDF (not just binary) in the email, read the contents, and check if the invoice is valid.\n",
    "2. **Use `pdfplumber` or other PDF processing tools**: I’ll add a PDF reading tool using `pdfplumber` to extract the invoice details from the actual PDF file.\n",
    "3. **Agent interaction**: The agent will dynamically process the PDF data (using the tools) and validate the invoice according to your criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan:\n",
    "1. **Read the PDF attachment**: We'll use `pdfplumber` to extract text data from the PDF attached to the email.\n",
    "2. **Validate vendor and invoice**: We'll use the tools to look up vendor status and invoice history.\n",
    "3. **Forward invalid invoices for human review**: We'll keep this part intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Incorporate PDF extraction from attachments** (we'll simulate handling PDF with actual extraction logic).\n",
    "2. **Check the extracted data** against criteria like vendor ID, invoice ID, and vendor email, and then make eligibility decisions.\n",
    "3. **Valid invoices**: Store them and send the results for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you could refactor the code to incorporate these changes properly:\n",

    "2. **Dynamic Data Validation**: The agent uses the actual tools to validate vendor status, invoice status, and extract data from the PDF dynamically.\n",
    "3. **Forwarding Invalid Invoices**: Invoices flagged as invalid (whether due to vendor issues or payment status) are forwarded for human review.\n",

    "#### Would you like further clarification or need any specific adjustments to this setup?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "this is overly necessary. i want this simple. you have tools developed to look up the invoice and vendor and the email what i want is the base instruction sent to the agent around eligible invoices and the email so the agent can use the tools and make a decision. when that decision is the invoice is valid then process it to the csv as we discussed if the invoice is invalid use the tool to send it to a human.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "response:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Got it! Let's simplify the logic and focus on the core steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Instructions**: We'll create clear instructions for the agent on how to check invoice eligibility and handle emails.\n",
    "2. **Tools**: The tools you already have will be used for validation (invoice lookup, vendor lookup, and email check).\n",
    "3. **Outcome**: If the invoice is valid, we'll process it (store in CSV). If invalid, we'll forward it to a human using the tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplified Approach:\n",
    "1. **Agent Instructions**: Provide clear guidance to the agent to:\n",
    "   - Validate the vendor (active and matching email).\n",
    "   - Check the invoice status (has it been paid or entered).\n",
    "   - If valid, save it to a list (that can be later processed to CSV).\n",
    "   - If invalid, forward it for human review using the `forward_for_review` tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tools**: \n",
    "   - Use the **vendor lookup** to ensure the vendor is active and the email matches.\n",
    "   - Use the **invoice lookup** to check if the invoice is already entered or paid.\n",

    "1. **Agent Instructions**:\n",
    "   - The agent uses the tools (`vendor_lookup`, `invoice_lookup`) to validate the invoice and vendor.\n",
    "   - If valid, the invoice details are added to the `valid_invoices` list.\n",
    "   - If invalid, the invoice is forwarded for human review with `forward_for_review`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Valid and Invalid Handling**:\n",
    "   - **Valid invoices** are processed and stored.\n",
    "   - **Invalid invoices** are forwarded to a human for further review.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplified Workflow**:\n",
    "   - The email is processed with the `process_email` function, and depending on the result, either it's marked as valid or forwarded for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach should be much simpler, focusing on the tools you've already set up for vendor and invoice lookups while making the eligibility decision via the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like further adjustments or if I can assist you in other ways!\n",

    "1. **Correct Input Format**: The error you encountered is likely because of the way the input was passed to the agent. We need to ensure the input is passed in the correct format — specifically, the agent expects the input as a dictionary when processing email data.\n",

    "1. **Input format for agent**: The key issue in your error was how the agent was receiving the input.

    "2. **Pass email data as a dictionary**: We are now passing `{\"input\": email_json}` instead of directly sending the JSON to the agent, ensuring compatibility.\n",

    "### Final Notes:\n",
    "This version addresses your original validation errors, properly formats the email input for the agent, and ensures the logic processes the invoices correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please give this version a try, and let me know if you encounter any further issues!\n",

    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Base64 encoding**: The `encode_pdf_attachment()` function reads a PDF from the file system, encodes it in base64, and stores it as a string. This string is then included in the JSON payload that the agent will process. This approach ensures that the PDF can be transmitted as part of the JSON data without causing errors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Updated email JSON structure**: The `attachment` field in the `valid_email_json` now contains a base64-encoded PDF, which is safe for inclusion in a JSON object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The rest of the logic** remains unchanged — the agent checks the validity of the invoice, forwards it for human review if necessary, and stores the valid invoices in a list for downstream processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test the solution:\n",
    "- Place a sample PDF (`sample_invoice.pdf`) in the same directory where this script runs.\n",
    "- This code will base64-encode that PDF and simulate email processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if this resolves the issue or if you need further adjustments!\n",

    "1. **Generate Sample PDF**: I added the `generate_sample_pdf()` function, which generates a simple invoice in PDF format using `reportlab`. The invoice contains some sample information like invoice ID, vendor name, amount, and date.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Base64 Encode the PDF**: Once the sample PDF is generated, the `encode_pdf_attachment()` function base64 encodes it to simulate how it would be transmitted in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process Email**: The email JSON now includes the base64-encoded PDF, which is used in the agent’s logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing:\n",
    "1. **Run the script**: After generating the PDF, the script will simulate the email with the base64-encoded PDF and process it using the agent.\n",
    "2. **Output**: You’ll see the invoice details printed out for valid invoices, and any invalid invoices will be forwarded for human review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution should now work as expected. Let me know if you need further adjustments!\n",

    "### Breakdown of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Error Assignment**:\n",
    "   - **Mismatch of Vendor ID**: 10% of the emails will have a mismatched vendor ID (assigned to ID 3, which does not exist).\n",
    "   - **Inactive Vendors**: 5% of the emails will have an inactive vendor (vendor ID 2, which is inactive).\n",
    "   - **Existing Invoices**: 5% of the invoices will match an existing invoice ID (101, 102, or 103) in the `invoice_database`.\n",
    "   - **New Entries for Already Existing Invoices**: 5% of valid invoices will be randomly inserted into the database to simulate a valid invoice that already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PDF Generation**:\n",
    "   - Each email has a generated sample PDF with the invoice ID, vendor name, amount, and description.\n",
    "   - The PDF is saved and then base64-encoded to simulate the attachment in an email.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Randomized Email Content**:\n",
    "   - The email content includes the vendor information, invoice ID, amount, and attachment (base64-encoded PDF).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - 100 email samples are generated. You can inspect the first 5 emails printed out to verify the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Testing the Generated Emails**: You can use the `generated_email_samples` list to simulate processing with the agent or forward them for review based on the error conditions.\n",
    "- **Processing with the Agent**: You can use the previously defined agent functions (`check_invoice_eligibility`, `forward_for_review`) to process these emails and see which invoices are valid or need review based on the logic we’ve built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like to proceed with additional processing or adjustments!\n",

    "3. **Process Invoices**:\n",
    "   - The `process_invoices` function loops through all invoices, checks their validity using `check_invoice_eligibility`, and either processes the valid invoices or forwards invalid ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate Email Samples**:\n",
    "   - We simulate generating 100 emails with random errors based on the rules you provided (e.g., mismatched vendor IDs, inactive vendors, existing invoices).\n",
    "   - Each email contains a sample PDF attachment (simulated as base64-encoded data).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Output**:\n",
    "   - After processing, we print out the first 5 valid invoices and the first 5 invalid invoices forwarded for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- You can now use this approach to process all invoices, store valid invoices in a CSV or database, and forward invalid invoices for human review.\n",
    "- The invoices can be processed based on the `valid_invoices` and `invalid_invoices_for_review` lists.\n",

    "1. **Error Reason**:\n",
    "   - In the `check_invoice_eligibility` function, an `error_reason` is added to the invoice dictionary when an invoice fails validation. This describes why the invoice cannot be processed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Forwarding with Error Reason**:\n",
    "   - The `forward_for_review` function now includes the `error_reason` when forwarding the invoice for human review. This will help the reviewer understand the exact reason why the invoice could not be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Valid Invoices**:\n",
    "   - These invoices will be printed with a message stating they were processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Invalid Invoices for Human Review**:\n",
    "   - Invalid invoices will be forwarded to human review, with a detailed reason explaining why they could not be processed (e.g., vendor mismatch, inactive vendor, email mismatch, already existing invoice).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output for Invalid Invoice:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Forwarding Invoice 105 for human review. Reason: Invalid Vendor ID: 3 for Invoice 105\n",
    "Forwarding Invoice 103 for human review. Reason: Inactive Vendor: Vendor B for Invoice 103\n",
    "Forwarding Invoice 101 for human review. Reason: Email mismatch for Invoice 101 (Expected: JOE_PESCI@BOSE.COM)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should provide the required information to aid the human in triaging the invoices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if this works or if further adjustments are needed!\n",

    "response:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ChatGPT is used in this context primarily as the agent responsible for processing incoming email data, making decisions about invoice eligibility, and forwarding invalid invoices for human review. The core logic of this process involves checking various conditions like vendor validity, invoice uniqueness, and email matching, which is performed within the script, with the agent facilitating the decision-making process based on these checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify where ChatGPT is applied, here's the breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Role**:\n",
    "   - The agent (representing ChatGPT in this case) uses tools that were previously developed (for checking vendor status, invoice validity, etc.). \n",
    "   - It processes incoming email data (simulated invoices) and makes decisions based on the defined business rules (whether the invoice is eligible or not).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Decision-making**:\n",
    "   - The agent uses tools like `check_invoice_eligibility()` to assess if the invoice matches certain criteria. These checks include:\n",
    "     - Whether the vendor is active.\n",
    "     - Whether the invoice ID and vendor ID match.\n",
    "     - Whether the sender's email matches the registered email for the vendor.\n",
    "     - Whether the invoice is already recorded in the system.\n",
    "   - If the invoice passes these checks, it is considered valid and processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Forwarding Invalid Invoices for Review**:\n",
    "   - When an invoice fails to meet the criteria, the agent includes a detailed error reason (like mismatched vendor ID or inactive vendor) and forwards the invoice for human review with this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, **ChatGPT** is used as a virtual agent to make decisions based on the available data (invoices and vendors) and use the tools to interact with the simulated system. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're referring to the direct use of ChatGPT's language model API, we can integrate it more explicitly to handle some aspects, like generating reports or summarizing errors. Would you like a clearer use case for integrating ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities for this task?\n",

This gets easier here as we can fold something like this into fabric/power automate easily with this code where fabric will watch the incoming emails and we can either trigger the bot via api."
